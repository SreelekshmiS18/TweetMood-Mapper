# TweetMood-Mapper

**Description:**
TweetMood Mapper is an innovative project aimed at analyzing the sentiments expressed in tweets. By leveraging machine learning techniques, this project seeks to classify tweets into various sentiment categories—positive, negative, and neutral—providing valuable insights into public opinion on diverse topics.

The core of the project utilizes a dataset of 13,870 tweets collected via the Twitter API. The analysis is conducted through a robust machine learning pipeline that employs a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier along with Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) for effective feature extraction.

**Key Features:**
- **Sentiment Classification**: Automatically classifies tweets into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments.
- **Data Visualization**: Includes visual representations of sentiment trends over time.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Designed for ease of use, allowing users to input their own datasets for analysis.

This project not only enhances understanding of social media sentiments but also serves as a useful tool for businesses and researchers aiming to gauge public sentiment on various issues.
